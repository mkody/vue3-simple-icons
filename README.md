## Note
* Because [identifiers canâ€™t start with numeric literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Identifier_after_number), names beginning with numbers have them converted to English words. For example, the logo for 500px is available as `FiveHundredPxIcon`.
* Versioning follows the [Simple Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) package.
